The Eco Smart Bins project is a server-side application built using Node.js and Express.js, designed to manage and control eco-friendly smart waste bins. The project utilizes various npm packages to achieve its functionality:

    cors: This package enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow communication between the server and clients from different origins securely.

    dotenv: dotenv is used for loading environment variables from a .env file into process.env, allowing configuration settings to be kept separate from code and easily managed.

    express: Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js, utilized in this project for handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware.

    form-data: form-data is a library for creating form data objects, which is useful for sending form-encoded data in HTTP requests.

    jsonwebtoken: This package is used for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), enabling secure authentication and authorization mechanisms in the application.

    mailgun.js: mailgun.js is a client library for the Mailgun email service, used for sending transactional emails such as notifications and alerts from the application.

    mongodb: MongoDB is a NoSQL database used in this project for storing and managing data related to smart waste bins, users, and other application entities.

    recharts: Recharts is a charting library for React applications, utilized for generating dynamic and interactive charts such as line charts and pie charts to visualize data.

    socket.io: socket.io is a library for enabling real-time bidirectional communication between clients and servers using WebSockets. It is used in this project for implementing real-time features such as live updates and notifications.

    sslcommerz-lts: sslcommerz-lts is a package for integrating SSLCommerz, a payment gateway service, into the application for handling secure online payments.

Overall, the Eco Smart Bins project leverages these npm packages to create a robust and feature-rich server-side application for managing eco-friendly smart waste bins, providing functionalities such as authentication, data storage, real-time communication, and visualization of data through charts.
